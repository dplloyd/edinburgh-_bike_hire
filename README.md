## Summary

A mish mash of various data visualisation and analysis of City of Edinburgh's [cycle hire statistics](https://edinburghcyclehire.com/open-data). I'll add to this as I go.

Focusing on 2020, the impact of the 23 March lockdown on bike rentals is clear.  However, rentals pick up for some stations, possibly because of good weather, an unwillingness to use public transport, and quieter streets. Most of the stations seem to get busier as lockdown progresses, but there are clear bands of low use - see for example George Square, the heart of the old University of Edinburgh campus. 

There are two noticeable peaks in Cramond and Portobello in the same week. The cause of this is unknown, but it could be related to good weather. It might also be the case Portobello residents were using the scheme to travel to Cramond.
