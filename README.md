## Summary

Last updated: 21st November 2020

:bike:

A mish-mash of various data visualisation and analysis of City of Edinburgh's [cycle hire statistics](https://edinburghcyclehire.com/open-data). I'll add to this as I go.

## Downloading data

Run ```read_JSON_and_save_locally.R``` to download a local version of the data before running the plotting scripts. At time of writing, the resulting csv file is ~90MB.

## Ideas 

Will add to this list as I go. Suggestions welcome!

- [X] Station heatmap usage
- [ ] Network diagram showing flow
- [ ] Do people go uphill or downhill?
- [ ] How has overall usage changed year on year?
- [ ] Number of trips as a function of distance between stations


## Scripts table

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|trips_heat_map.R | Heatmaps of total trips taken in 2020 by station.
